hacREFACTOR PROJECT

The main goal of this was to make the codebase follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. 

While also making sure the HTML elements follow logical structure with semantic elements. 

I've also made sure to include accessible alt attributes. 

Consolidating style.css in semantic order makes it easier to read/edit and also makes it more accessible.

Doing these things makes this webpage more accessible.
